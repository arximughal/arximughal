"LAMP" stands for **L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, and **P**HP/**P**erl/**P**ython (we will be focusing on PHP here), a group of open-source applications that allow you to host your websites on a linux server i.e., Ubuntu, as in this case. Apache serves as your web server, MySQL is your most commonly used database, PHP is your scripting language and Linux is -- well, Linux. You can [read up more on these individual technologies more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)). 

In order to run a simple static HTML website, you don't need to install MySQL and/or PHP (or other scripting language runtime), you can host those with just Apache installed. But for more complex applications that require a database and a language run-time set up for communicating with the said database, the whole stack needs to be installed and configured properly. 

## Prerequisites
In order to continue with this tutorial, you need to have a linux server up & running at the very least. You can use any cloud service for that purpose. I personally prefer [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/405e254a416e) for most of my basic [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) needs and it is easy to set up and work with (if you click on [this link](https://m.do.co/c/405e254a416e) and [register on DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/405e254a416e), you will get $200 free credit to try out their services).

We won't be going in to the nitty gritty details on Linux permissions and firewall management and the likes. Most of the default configuration should be safe enough. So, let's get going then: 

## Step 1 - Install Apache
We are going to assume that you have a brand new VPS set up, SSH in to your server and execute the following command to update the package manager's cache: 
```
sudo apt update
```

If you execute the above command without a root user, and you are executing the `sudo` command for the first time, you will be prompted to enter your password. Enter your password and hit enter to continue. 

Now, execute the below command to install Apache: 
```
sudo apt install apache2
```
When prompted to confirm the installation, enter `Y` and hit `Enter` to confirm the installation and wait for the process to finish installing. 

Unless you have modified firewall configuration on your server, you should now have apache installed and serving traffic. Head out to the below mentioned URL and check your installation: 
```
http://[YOUR SERVER IP ADDRESS]
```
Replace "[YOUR SERVER IP ADDRESS]" with the public IP4 address of your server (continue beyond the image if you don't know the IP address). You should see a page that looks something like this: 

![Default Apache Webpage](/static/images/lamp-stack-ubuntu-server.jpeg "default apache webpage")
